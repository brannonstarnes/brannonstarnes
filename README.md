## About Me

Deep Sea Diver turned Full Stack Developer. I'm an explorer at heart and live for moments of discovery. I discovered my passion for development while attending a school to learn to operate Unmanned Underwater Vehicles. I was blown away by the technology utilized in those vehicles and that the 'brains' were essentially instructions written by a developer. My dream is to be part of a team that is pushing technological and scientific boundaries in order to further our understanding of our planet, our galaxy, our universe.
